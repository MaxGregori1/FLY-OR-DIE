# FLY-OR-DIE
The final project for my 2017-2018 Computer Science Class. 
It was exhibited at the 2018 Browning Tech Expo.

Name of Project: Fly-Or-Die

Description of the final project: This is a python-based game that is built on top the foundational concepts created by the classic mobile game “Flappy Bird.” Rather than being an exact replica though, I have attempted to refactor this game and personalize it as much as possible. The basic aim of the game it to simply guide an object through an assortment of obstructions that continually appear on the screen. Users control the flying object using solely the space bar. A click of the space bar increments the height of the flying object. Not pressing the spacebar will cause the object to drop towards the ground. If the object hits the ground, or any obstruction on the screen, the game will reset. For every obstacle which users manage to guide the flying object through, they gain a single point. May the highest score win!
